#Stackdriver Monitor

This is a small application which you can send mtrics (ram used in percentuage for now) to Google Stackdriver monitor.

##Wath you should do

* Create a custom metric 
* Rename or copy the options-axample.json as options.json and replace placeholder with real value

* `npm install`  install dependecies
* `node monitor.js`

**IMPORTANT**
This script works just in windows for now. I :sparkling_heart: linux but what I needed is that script runs on windows server.
